Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use
of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across
her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. ",
              "From Chapter 2: \"A Merry Christmas\"
\"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word
before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled
into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came
to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"
They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo
exclaimed impetuously, \"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"

\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked Beth eagerly.

\"I shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving up the article she most liked.
Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one big plate.

\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You shall all go and help me, and when we come back
we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\"

They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was early, and they went through back streets, so
few people saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.

A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby,
and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.

How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.

\"Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman, crying for joy.
\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them to laughing.

In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a
fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel,
and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The
girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing,
talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.

\"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable
blaze. The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been
considered a 'Sancho' ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of it. And
when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry
little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.

\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said Meg, as they set out their presents while their
mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.",
              "From \"There's No One Left\"
When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most
disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body,
thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born
in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English
Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only
to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.

She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was
made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.
So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly,
fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark
faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything,
because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old
she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read
and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try
to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know
how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.

One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became
crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.
\"Why did you come?\" she said to the strange woman. \"I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.\"
The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself
into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the
Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the
native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But
no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and
at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended
that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time
growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie
when she returned.",

              "Listen, my children, and you shall hear \n
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, \n
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\n
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.
He said to his friend, \"If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
Of the North Church tower as a signal light,-
One, if by land, and two, if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.\"
Then he said, \"Good night!\" and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war;
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon like a prison bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers,
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,-
Up the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.",
              "When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous
vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted
brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely
cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.
\"What's happened to me?\" he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small
side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all
spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine
and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up
against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.

Gregor's eyes then turned to the window, and the overcast weather--he could hear raindrops hitting against the
metal window ledge--completely depressed him. \"How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting
all this nonsense,\" he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side
and in his present state could not get into that position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he
always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his
squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.",
              "ACT V. SCENE I.
Dunsinane. Anteroom in the castle.
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman.
 Doctor. I have two nights watch'd with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walk'd?

 Gentlewoman. Since his majesty went into the field, have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her,
unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this
while in a most fast sleep.

 Doctor. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this
slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?

 Gentlewoman. That, sir, which I will not report after her.

 Doctor. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.

 Gentlewoman. Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to confirm my speech.

 Enter Lady Macbeth, with a taper.

Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise, and upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

 Doctor. How came she by that light?

 Gentlewoman. Why, it stood by her. She has light by her continually; 'tis her command.

 Doctor. You see her eyes are open.

 Gentlewoman. Ay, but their sense are shut.

 Doctor. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.

 Gentlewoman. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this
a quarter of an hour.

 Lady Macbeth. Yet here's a spot.

 Doctor. Hark! She speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

 Lady Macbeth. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One; two. Why, then, 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A
soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to accompt? Yet who would have
thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?

 Doctor. Do you mark that?

 Lady Macbeth. The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No more o'
that, my lord, no more o' that! You mar all with this starting.",
              "Since the invention of GUTs in 1974, particle theorists have been vigorously
working on attempts to construct the ultimate theory of nature-an elegant
theory which would include a quantum description of gravity. The characteristic
energy scale of such a theory is presumably the Planck scale, 10^19GeV, a point
at which the gravitational interactions of elementary particles become
comparable in strength to the other types of interactions. It is then hoped that a
GUT would emerge as a low-energy approximation.
The latest and most successful of these attempts at unification is a radically new
kind of particle theory known as 'superstring theory.' Superstrings represent a
dramatic departure from conventional theories in that particles are viewed as
ultramicroscopic strings (length = 10^-33 centimeters). Furthermore, according to
this theory, the universe has nine spatial dimensions. Early in the history of the
universe, when the temperature cooled below 10^32 degrees Kelvin, all spatial
dimensions, except the three we know today, stopped expanding and remained
curled up with an unobservably small extent. As bizarre as the theory may
sound, the superstring theory has been shown to possess a number of unique
properties crucial to a quantum theory of gravity, and it has totally captured the
attention of a large fraction of the worldwide particle theory community.",
              "Beginning in 1740, a series of crises undermined the stability of these
established political and social orders. Religious turmoil, war with France, and
an economic cycle of boom and bust struck in rapid succession. Britain's sudden
imposition of new measures of taxation and control prompted riots, petitions,
and the movement for American independence. By 1775, many colonists had
repudiated British rule and the traditional monarchical system of government.
Many other Americans actively questioned the authority of existing religious
institutions and the legitimacy of established political and social distinctions.
The struggle for home rule raised the crucial question of who should rule at
home.
Between 1776 and 1820, the citizens of the new United States created a
republican institutional order. While fighting a financially draining war against
Great Britain, they devised effective state constitutions and governments.
Subsequently, they organized themselves into a strong national union and began
the expansion into the trans-Appalachian west. Americans debated, argued, and
even fought bitterly with one another during these years. They were divided into
distinct social groups, each seeking to defend or extend its own values and
interests.
In the end, American Revolution had both radical and conservative results."
